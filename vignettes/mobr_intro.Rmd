# Installing `mobr`

The package `mobr` is currently available on GitHub and you can freely download 
the source code here [mobr on GitHub](https://github.com/MoBiodiv/mobr)

The easiest option is to install the package directly from GitHub using the package `devtools`. If you do not already have `devtools` installed then need to install it.

```{r, eval = F}
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)
```

The package also requires the `dplyr` package which has many dependencies. If you do 
not already have the `dplyr` package installed we suggest you install it and 
all of its dependencies using :

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages(c('bindrcpp','glue','pkgconfig','tibble','plyr','dplyr'))
```

Then check that `dplyr` can be loaded with `library(dplyr)`.
Now you should be ready to go with the `mobr` install

```{r, eval=F}
install_github('MoBiodiv/mobr')
```

If you receive an error we would love to receive your bug report 
[here](https://github.com/MoBiodiv/mobr/issues)

# Data structure required by `mobr`

To work with `mobr` you need two matrix-like data tables:

1. Species abundance data in a community matrix (rows are sites and columns are species)

2. A site attributes table (rows are sites and columns are site attributes)

The community matrix must include the number of individuals of each species.

The table with the plot attributes can include for instance spatial coordinates
of plots, experimental treatments and/or environmental variables. If spatial
coordinates are supplied they must be named "x" and "y" for the easting and
northing respectively. If temporal trends are of interest rather than 
spatial you simply set either x or y to a single number and put the temporal
measurement for the other coordinate. 

Throughout this vignette we use an example of a study on the effects of an
invasive plant _Lonicera maackii_ on understory plant biodiversity in a Missouri
woodland (Powell et al. 2003)

This data set is included in `mobr`and available after loading the library

```{r, message=FALSE}
library(mobr)
data(inv_comm)      # Community matrix
data(inv_plot_attr) # Plot attributes data.frame
```

```{r}
str(inv_comm)
head(inv_plot_attr)
```

The plot attributes include the information if a plot is located in invaded or
uninvaded sites as well as the spatial xy coordinates of a plot.

## Preparing data

In order to analyse the data with `mobr` the two data tables have to be combined
into on single object

```{r}
inv_mob_in <- make_mob_in(inv_comm, inv_plot_attr)
inv_mob_in
```

# Exploratory data analysis

The package `mobr` offers functions for exploratory data analysis and visualization.

First let's look at the spatial rarefaction curve in which samples are
added depending on their spatial proximity. 

```{r, fig.width = 5, fig.height = 5}
plot_rarefaction(inv_mob_in, 'group', 'uninvaded', 'spat', lwd=4)
```

We can see that invasion decreases richness and that the magnitude of the effect
depends on scale. Let's dig in further to see if we can better understand
exactly what components of the community are changing due to invasion.

First we look at the individual rarefaction curves for each treatment which
only reflect the shape of the SAD (i.e., no individual density or aggregation effects):

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height=4}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot_rarefaction(inv_mob_in, 'group', 'uninvaded', 'indiv', pooled=F, lwd=2,
                 leg_loc='topright')
plot_rarefaction(inv_mob_in, 'group', 'uninvaded', 'indiv', pooled=T, lwd=4,
                 leg_loc=NA)
```

Visually you can see there are some big differences in total numbers individuals
(i.e., how far on the x-axis the curves go). We can also see that for small 
numbers of individuals the invaded sites are actually more diverse! This is 
a bit surprising and it implies that the invaded sites have greater evenness. 
We can directly examine the species abundance distribution (SAD):

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height=4}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
plot_abu(inv_mob_in, 'group', 'uninvaded', type='rad', pooled=F, log='x')
plot_abu(inv_mob_in, 'group', 'uninvaded', type='rad', pooled=T, log='x')
```

The SADs suggest that there are differences in the SADs where the invaded
site has greater evenness in its common species (i.e., flatter left hand-side 
of rank curve). 

# Two-scale analysis

There are a myriad of biodiversity indices. We have attempted to chose a subset
of metrics that can all be derived from the individual rarefaction curve which
capture the aspects of biodiversity we are most interested in, namely:

1. Numbers of individuals (i.e., density effects)
2. The distribution of rarity and commonness (i.e., the SAD)
3. The spatial patchiness or aggregation of conspecifics.

The metrics we have selected are:

* **N - Number of individuals**
* **S - Observed species richness**
* **S_rarefied - Rarefied species richness (Hurlbert 1971)**
* **S_asymptote - Estimated asymptotic species richness using biased corrected method (Chiu et al. 2014)**
* **PIE - Probability of Interspecific Encounter (Hurlbert 1971)**
* **S_PIE - Effective number of species based on PIE (Jost 2007)**

Each of these metrics can be computed for either the sample or group scale individual rarefaction curves as shown in the figure below: 

![](../vignettes/metrics.png){ width=85% }

The ratio of a given biodiversity metric at the group and sample scales
(i.e., $\beta_S = S_{group} / S_{sample}$ can provide simple measures of
species turnover or \(\beta\)-diversity. Depending on which metric the 
\(\beta\)-diversity is derived from will determine what aspects of species
turnover it is most sensitive too (e.g., $\beta_{asymptote}$ is more sensitive 
to turnover in rare species).


```{r, eval = FALSE}
inv_stats <- get_mob_stats(inv_mob_in, group_var = "group", 
                           ref_group = 'uninvaded', n_perm = 200)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
load('../vignettes/inv_stats.Rdata')
```

We can examine the `inv_stats` object 

```{r}
names(inv_stats)
```

There are also functions for plotting the indices at the sample and group levels.
First let's examine species richness:

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3.5}
plot(inv_stats, 'S')
```

Invasion appears to decrease local sample diversity but not gamma diversity.
Somewhat surprisingly it appears to increase \(\beta\)diversity. 

One of the major effects we observed in the individual rarefaction curve was 
that the invaded sites appeared to have fewer individuals, let's examine the 
test of that:

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 4.5}
plot(inv_stats, 'N')
```

Clearly our intuition was correct there is a very strong negative effect of 
invasion on N. So it appears that the changes we observed in S may be due to 
the negative effect of invasion on N. Let's examine `S_rare` to test this:

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3.5}
plot(inv_stats, 'S_rare')
```

```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 3.5}
plot(inv_stats, 'S_PIE')
```

We can also plot `S_asymp` but for this dataset this metric
does not show strong patterns so we'll stop here for now. If you 
want to plot all the biodiversity metrics at once you can simply use:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(inv_stats)
# alternatively
plot(inv_stats, multi_panel = TRUE)
```

# Continuous scale analysis

The continuous scale analysis using `mobr` aims at disentangling the 
consequences of three biodiversity components on observed changes in species
richness

1. **Species abundance distribution (SAD)**
2. **Number of individuals (N)**
3. **Aggregation (clumping) of conspecific individuals**

To accomplish this we use three different rarefaction curves which each 
capture different aspects of community structure:

![](../vignettes/rarefaction_curves.png){ width=75% }

If we examine the difference between each of these curves in our two treatments
we can learn how the treatment influences richness via its effects on 
different components of community structure.

![](../vignettes/deltaS_concept.png){ width=95% }

We can carry out this analysis in `mobr` using the function `get_delta_stats`.
For the sake of speed we'll run the analysis with just 20 permutations but 
at least 200 are recommended for actual applications. 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
inv_deltaS = get_delta_stats(inv_mob_in, 'group', ref_group='uninvaded',
                             type='discrete', log_scale=TRUE, n_perm = 20)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load('../vignettes/inv_deltaS.Rdata')
```

The best way to examine the contents of this object is to plot it. 
First let's examine the three rarefaction curves:

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5}
plot(inv_deltaS, 'invaded', 'uninvaded', display='rarefaction')
```

Now let's consider the differences between each set of curves:

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5}
plot(inv_deltaS, 'invaded', 'uninvaded', display='delta S')
```

Lastly, we can isolate the individual effects of each component by taking one
more difference between the curves:

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=3.5}
plot(inv_deltaS, 'invaded', 'uninvaded', display='ddelta S')
```

The grey polygons above represent the 95% quantile for the null models of
no treatment effect. 

Let's examine these individual effects across in a way that is easier to compare
their effects using the function `overlap_effects`

```{r, fig.width=7, fig.height=4}
par(mfrow=c(1,2))
overlap_effects(inv_deltaS, 'invaded', display='raw')
overlap_effects(inv_deltaS, 'invaded', display='stacked', prop=T)
```

You can use these same kinds of analyses on your own datasets or on some of other datasets we have included with the package: 

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# plant community in response to a prescribed fire treatment in a
# central US woodland
data(fire_comm)
data(fire_plot_attr)

# aquatic invertebrates in experimental cattle tanks where nutrients
# were manipulated
data(tank_comm)
data(tank_plot_attr)
```
