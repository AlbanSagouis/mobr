#' mobr: measurement of biodiversity across scales
#' 
#' @section About:
#' 
#' The primary aim of this package is to provide ecologist's tools to examine 
#' changes in biodiversity across spatial scales.  Additionally the package
#' provides a method to examine how a factor mediates species richness via its
#' effets on different aspects of community structure: total abundance,
#' species commonness, and spatial aggregation of conspecifics.
